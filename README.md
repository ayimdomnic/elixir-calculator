# elixir-calculator

OK, this is stupid. I wrote this to get started in Elixir development. This is
**the very first piece of Elixir code I've ever written** and I'm 100% sure
it sucks :).

## Oh, what does it do?

It's a calculator. It calculates things.

For example, `$ ./calculator add 4 1` will add 4 to 1 and return 5. Surprise, surprise.

## How do I get this thing running?

1. Install Elixir,
2. Clone the repo,
3. `$ mix compile && mix escriptize`
4. `$ ./calculator add 4 1`
5. DISCO! (or whatever)

## It's return values are weird.

Yeah, I know. I'm flattening everything down to floats, so Elixir (or probably Erlang) displays output in [E notation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_notation#E_notation). Unfortunately I didn't find a sane workaround when I was writing this. Bummer.

## The code looks stupid. Are you stupid?

I am, but that's a different story ;). As far as the code goes - look, this is my first take at Elixir, so just let it go. I promise I'll write better code next time, OK?

## There's no tests.

I know and I'm not gonna write any. It's late and I feel like some CS:Source. Wanna join, maybe?

## What's the license?

The usual for me - MIT License.

## Who are you?

I'm Tomek WÃ³jcik. I code for a living. The rest is irrelevant.
